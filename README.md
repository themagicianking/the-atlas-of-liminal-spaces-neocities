## To Do
- [ ] **Improve mobile support/create breakpoints for better responsiveness**
- [ ] Style submission form and route responses to my email
- [ ] Create template page for "physical" type maps
- [ ] Create template page for "intangible" type maps
- [ ] Find a good place to host backend for simple API calls (will not be hosting photos; just map entries)
- [ ] Route credit to GitHub instead of tumblr in footer
- [ ] Create reusable components for header, footer, and map

## Notes
- Currently the submission page does not work; I have it up for styling only. Submissions do not go anywhere and there is no form validation.
