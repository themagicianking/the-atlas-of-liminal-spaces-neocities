            Description of the featured liminal space goes here. In the
            meantime, I have instead put here the poem
          </p>
          <p>July in Appalachia by Keaton St. James:</p>
          <p>
            ma says there’s an angel in the creek out behind old mr. henry’s
            shack. she saw it when she was seven years old, playing by herself
            while her pa helped mr. henry with his hay bales: sliced her bare
            foot open on a jagged rock, and the angel swam towards the blood in
            the water.
          </p>
          <p></p>
          <p>
            ma looked right into the angel’s six blind eyes and asked him, “how
            come you’re down here, sleepin’ in the mud, when you could be up in
            heaven, plantin’ sunflowers for god?”
          </p>
          <p>
            his wings were like a dragonfly’s, transparent and glimmerin’, and
            his halo was a ring of algae. the angel grinned, three rows of sharp
            teeth, and said, “girlie, god has plans for the bluegills too.”
